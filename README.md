ImageJ Updater
--------------

The ImageJ Updater is a mechanism to update individual packages in ImageJ. The
Updater keeps users up-to-date with all components of ImageJ, including both
plugins and the core components (libraries) needed by the plugins.

The ImageJ Updater can handle 3rd-party update sites: anybody with write access
to a web server can [set up their own update
site](http://wiki.imagej.net/How_to_set_up_and_populate_an_update_site) which
users can decide to follow.

For more details, see the [Updater](http://wiki.imagej.net/Updater) page on the
ImageJ wiki.
