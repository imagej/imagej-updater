 * A helper class for the Checksummer.

 * When checksumming manifests for the Updater, we would like to ignore
 * certain entries such as Implementation-Build because they do not provide
 * substantial changes and are likely to differ between builds even if the
 * real content does not.
 * 
 * This class takes an InputStream that is expected to represent a manifest
 * and offers an InputStream which skips the mentioned entries.
