 * A helper class for the Checksummer.

 * when writing pom.properties and nar.properties files. This date is a
 * non-functional change which we would like to ignore when checking whether a
 * .jar file is up-to-date.
 * 
 * This class takes an InputStream that is expected to represent a .properties
 * file and offers an InputStream which skips the lines starting with a '#'.
